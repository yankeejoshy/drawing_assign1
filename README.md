# Drawing on the Web Assignment 4 - Version Control and Collab (Partner Remix)
## Original Designer: Irina Didenko (https://github.com/Irina673)

### Original Project
The original project by Irina featured a combination of videos of a fishtank, bubbles, and jellyfish in the background.<br>
Together with the dark blue filter, it simulated looking at jellyfish in a fish tank. The quick jellyfish movement and the upbeat music gave a **vibrant** and **exciting** vibe to the experience.

### Inspiration
When I began thinking of how to remix this project, I struggled for a while to come up with any ideas distinct enough to call my own.
I decided to unpeel the onion that was this project, looking at each individual layer of videos to find some inspiration.
In the video of the fishtank, I found fish swimming around that Irina smartly masked by darkening the video.
This provided me some inspiration, and I eventually thought of inverting this onion and reversing the roles of the viewer.
That is, instead of looking **into** the fish tank, I could make it feel like you were in the fish tank looking **out**.

### Resources
I started by searching for videos of people walking around that I would use as the background video. I settled upon this densely populated one as it felt like a big crowd at an airport, or a shopping mall.
Then, I looked for alternate resources for the fish tank, but in the end I felt that the one Irina used meshed really well with the bubbles, and was simple enough to accommodate anything else.
I decided I wanted a more peaceful feeling in the fish tank as opposed to the busier, faster paced "rat-race" going on outside the fish tank.
I settled on this wonderful piano piece called Wet Hands, by a German artist called C418 *(see-four-eighteen)* that was one of my favorite pieces in Minecraft.

### Putting it Together
Well, there wasn't much to this besides replacing the video source files, and changing some of the CSS values to create the ambience that I wanted with a lighter color hue and lower opacity.
I also animated the entire video frame, making it sway up and down and giving it a slight horizontal rotation to try to make the viewer feel like they are moving in the fish tank, but this was hard to make realistic. I'm still not too sure that I managed to get the effect I was looking for.

###Conclusion
And there you have it! I feel like it's fitting that the song I picked for this project was Wet Hands. Water is wet. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
